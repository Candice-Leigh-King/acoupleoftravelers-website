      <p>Our first flight ever as a couple, in fact, Jay's first time on an airplane! Now, in my opinion, 3 days is not long enough to really enjoy Iceland. However, as we were currently working our traditional 9-5s, this is all the time we had, and we wanted to explore, so we didn't let timing stop us! Iceland is known as " The Land of Fire and Ice!" and features midnight sun in the summer, and the northern lights in the winter. We went in July when the weather was surprisingly good, and experienced the midnight sun!&nbsp;</p><p>Let's start with flights! We scored great flights via the app Hopper! Round trip DFW to KEF for only $400 each on United Airlines! We sat in economy, which wasn't bad at all, as we had our first layover in Newark airport, then only a 6 hour flight! Food was great, I could not sleep because of excitement, but per usual, Jay fell asleep, as he can sleep just about anywhere. It was definitely a great first flight in his book.&nbsp;</p><p>With 3 days only in Reykjavik, we stayed in one place only- &nbsp;the Reykjavik Lights Hotel! A combination of northern lights and Icelandic calendar inspired hotel with Laugardalur outdoor park located across the road, and in close proximity to the Icelandic Phallological Museum, the Sun Voyager, a stainless steel boat sculpture, and the mall! The breakfast buffet is complimentary, and the hotel also features a bar and bike rentals! There is also a bus stop located across the street, which is what we took when going down to the city center of reykjavik.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>We arrived early in the morning, so we had a full day ahead! We asked the hotel to store our bags until check in, and we were off! We started the day by walking to the places in close proximity, mentioned above, and spent most of our time at the mall! It was very interesting to see the different stores that we do not have in the DFW area. There was even a grocery store!! Where we bought a couple of Icelandic snacks and wine. From there we walked back to the hotel to drop off everything we bought, and set off to the city center!&nbsp;</p><p>Our first matter of business was to go to B&aelig;jarins Beztu Pylsur! This "hot dog" stand has been around since 1937 and is world renowned! and MAN!!! We still dream of this hot dog. An Icelandic hot dog is made from a combination of pork, beef, and mostly lamb. Because of the grassfed, roam free Icelandic sheep, you can really taste how different and delicious it is compared to the american hot dog.&nbsp;</p><p>We continued onto Laugavegur, which is the oldest and largest shopping street in Iceland! I do recommend a city tour if you are wanting a guide to give you the "lay of the land." I will link all tours at the bottom of this post! Be sure not to miss Hallgrimskrkj, the iconic church in Reykjavik. There are many parks, buildings, museums, bakeries, and shops to stop at. Our favorite place for icelandic ice cream was Valdis, and our favorite bakery was BraudCo- they are famous for their cinnamon rolls!&nbsp;</p>

      <p>The golden circle! We booked a tour through Viator Travel, and they picked us up directly from the hotel! This is one of the most touristic things to do in Iceland, but so worth it! You get to see Icelands beautiful scenery, and learn about this history along the way! Starting off with&nbsp;</p><p>&THORN;ingvellir (Thingvellir) national park! This is an UNESCO world heritage site. The park sits within a rift valley, causing the separation of two tectonic plates! This is the site of the world's oldest existing parliament! You can even scuba dive between the tectonic plates in Silfra Fissure to see the crystal clear water. Soon after taking in the sights and learning all about the area from our tour guide, we headed off to Strokkur Geysir which explodes with water every 5-10 minutes. As we walked to the site, you can see the steam lifting from the ground! Next, our tour included a stop at a local family farm. We were welcomed by the free roam sheep and adorable dogs they had on property. We went inside where they had a small restaurant, and HOMEMADE ice cream! It was absolutely divine. We got to see the cows they had on property, and one sweet baby tried to eat my shirt! I was in love! After about 45 minutes, we headed off to Gullfoss waterfall, one of the largest in Iceland. As you walk down you'll feel the mist on your face! Which was very refreshing as it was about 70 degrees fahrenheit! Our tour guide said we had brought the Texas weather with us. This was a sight to see, and we even saw a rainbow right above. It was so beautiful.&nbsp;</p><p>We were so tired, in the best way possible, from our day of adventures. We grabbed something local to the hotel to eat, and went to bed early to prepare for our 3rd and final full day!&nbsp;</p>

      <p>BLUE LAGOON HERE WE COME! The Blue Lagoon is a geothermal spa in southwestern Iceland. The spa is located in a lava field near Grindav&iacute;k! Our tickets we bought included roundtrip transport from our hotel, and entry into the lagoon! It was a bit pricey, but so worth it, in our opinion! We took photos all round the property, as the rocky, space-like landscape plus the water, was a view to remember. We went in and prepped for the lagoon! you must shower before entry, And PLEASE put the conditioner in your hair that they provide in the cost of your ticket- it's a lifesaver, as the water contains high amounts of silica which is where it gets its milky blue shade! We purchased the basic entry fee, which included a face mask, and a free drink of choice. I chose a wine, and Jay went with a local beer! The Blue Lagoon also features a hotel, multiple restaurants, massages, sauna, and more!&nbsp;</p><p>After our time at the blue lagoon, we headed back to the hotel! We cleaned up, and went back to the city center for our last night. We were sure to eat more traditional foods, and snack at all the places we loved so much our first day.&nbsp;</p><p>Although we only had 3 full days, I would say we had a fantastic time! There is so much to see in Iceland, and we do plan on coming back, and spending a lot more time there, hopefully we will travel the famous ring road!</p>
