      <p><strong>THE ULTIMATE GUIDE TO KEY WEST, FLORIDA</strong></p><p>&nbsp;
      What do you think of when you think of Key West? Do you think water
      sports, Key Lime Pie, Or Dry Tortugas National Park? Key West is all of
      those things and more!</p><p>&nbsp; Also known as The Conch Republic, Key
      West is colorful and lively! The locals are quirky and kind. There&rsquo;s
      something for everyone here. Well, minus kids. I don&rsquo;t find Key West
      to be a very kid-friendly place.</p><p><strong>How to get
      here:</strong></p><p>&nbsp; The easiest way is flying straight into the
      Key West airport. This is the way I recommend to everyone, especially if
      you don&rsquo;t have a lot of time. It&rsquo;s convenient, and I always
      enjoy walking off the plane, straight onto the tarmac, then into the
      physical airport! It&rsquo;s definitely a fun experience to be so up close
      and personal with the planes on the ground.</p><p>&nbsp; Another way would
      be to do a Florida Keys road-trip from Miami! It&rsquo;s about a 3 hour
      drive.. sometimes longer if traffic is backed up, but the views and stops
      along the way are breathtaking, and fun! We will do a post on that another
      day.</p><p><strong>Where to Stay:</strong></p><p>&nbsp; There are so many
      places to chose from. You can stay beach front, inland, in Stock Island,
      Old Town, etc.. Here is a list of my recommended hotels by
      category:</p><p><strong>Boutique hotels:</strong></p><p><a

      href="https://www.instagram.com/oceankeyresort/">@oceankeyresort</a></p><p><strong>What
      To Do:</strong></p><p>&nbsp; There are so many activities in Key West.
      Here are my top recommendations:</p><ul><li>Breakfast at Latitudes!
      Located on Sunset Key, this cute island has one of the best restaurants
      with a perfect view! You CAN&rsquo;T miss this. Reservations required well
      in advance! After you&rsquo;re done at breakfast, take a stroll around the
      island. It&rsquo;s beautiful, and will make you wish you stayed on-site in
      one of their cottages.</li><li>Catch sunset at Mallory Square and enjoy
      their sunset celebration! Or head to the roof top at Bistro 245, less
      crowded and the most beautiful view, with a rooftop bar too!</li><li>Jet
      Ski Tour!!! There are so many options! BUT we recommend Perry Excursions
      located at The Perry Hotel. They have an awesome guide named Tyler who is
      super knowledgeable about the island.</li><li>Dry Tortugas National Park
      tour! You can private charter a catamaran or take the ferry. Either way,
      this must be booked in advance.</li><li>Cocktail class at Tiki House! It
      has such a fun vibe, they make ICONIC drinks, and you can take a history
      of the Tiki cocktail class!</li><li>Lagerheads Beach Bar and Watersports!
      The Beach has CLEAR water, no seaweed (when we were there), an on-site
      beach bar with drinks &amp; yummy food (try their fish dip- perfect for
      the travel foodie). &amp; it really does not get as packed as I thought it
      would be.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a bit of a *hidden gem* in my
      opinion.</li><li>Fort Zachary Taylor State Park! Swim, grill out, and see
      some history!</li><li>Barefoot Billy&rsquo;s Sushi Sunset Cruise! FRESH
      sushi, a fun crew, and awesome views!</li><li>Sunset Sail with Fury!
      Unlimited drinks, yummy snacks, live music, and sunset!</li><li>Rent a
      boat, kayak or paddle board!</li><li>Go snorkeling and see all the marine
      life!</li><li>Head to the aquarium</li><li>Visit the Key West Butterfly
      Garden</li><li>Find all of the 6 toed cats and learn the history of
      Earnest Hemingway at the Hemingway house</li><li>Rent a Moke and explore
      the island! We found a lot of hidden gems and beautiful places this
      way.</li><li>Couples massage</li><li>Dolphin watch</li><li>Key west
      tropical forest &amp; botanical gardens stock island</li><li>Key west
      backcountry sandbar tour</li><li>West Martello gardens</li><li>Cuban
      coffee queen (Welcome to Key West mural)</li><li>Boutique
      shopping</li><li>Catch a movie at the tropical cinema</li><li>Old Town
      Trolley Tour</li><li>Shipwreck museum</li><li>Visit the Southernmost Point
      Bouy</li><li>Key West Lighthouse and Bahama Village</li><li>Smathers Beach
      or Higgs Beach</li><li>Sloppy Joe&rsquo;s is an iconic place for a
      drink!</li></ul><p><strong>Where to eat:</strong></p><ul><li>Bagatelle: If
      you&rsquo;re looking for a great meal, that won&rsquo;t break the bank,
      hit up Bagatelle! Their breakfast happy hour is phenomenal. My man is
      always hungry, so we have to keep him fed, LOL! Which can break the budget
      at times.. Places like this sure make it easy! You MUST sit at the bar for
      access to their breakfast happy hour!</li><li>The Lobster Shack: Key Lime
      Lobster Roll</li><li>Pok&egrave; in the Rear: Signature
      Drink</li><li>Lagerheads: Tequila, beer, &amp; fish dip!</li><li>Barefoot
      Billy&rsquo;s Sushi Sunset Cruise: lots of sushi!</li><li>Latitudes: Ocean
      front dining! The food = phenomenal! It is one of the best places to eat
      in the Florida Keys for sure. They have a complimentary ferry that drives
      you to &amp; from the restaurant! Breakfast is least expensive &amp; still
      has a fabulous view &amp; yummy food. So, if you want to dine here, but
      can&rsquo;t seem to snag that dinner reservation or want to spend a little
      less, come for breakfast! Look for reservations in advance!! I checked
      multiple times &amp; booked months in advance. You have got to go,
      especially if you&rsquo;re a foodie, into fine dining, or simply want to
      dine with a beautiful view</li><li>Blue Heaven for the ICONIC Key Lime
      Pie</li><li>Four Marlins: Beachfront dining. Food is amazing, and has one
      of the top 3 Key Lime pies on the island for sure! At least in our
      opinion.</li><li>First flight brewery</li><li>Breakfast at La
      Gringote</li><li>BYOB: Build your own burrito at Bad Boy Burrito! SO
      GOOD!</li><li>Better than Sex Key West! The first location of the romantic
      dessert only restaurant.</li><li>Amigo Bar</li><li>Falafel King</li><li>El
      Sibony for authentic Cuban food</li><li>Key West Original Conch
      Fritters</li></ul><p><strong>When to visit:</strong></p><p>&nbsp; I find
      that Key West is great any time of year! There are multiple events
      throughout the year that you wouldn&rsquo;t want to miss (food festivals,
      speed boat races, Fantasy Fest, NYE, etc.) Or maybe you do want to miss,
      in order to avoid the crowds. If that&rsquo;s the case, be sure to check
      Key West&rsquo;s event calendar before booking. Winter time is considered
      high season, meaning prices are higher and it&rsquo;s more busy than
      usual. Hurricane season is June-November, but hotel rates are typically
      cheapest then. March-May seems to be a good middle point. It&rsquo;s right
      when high season tapers off, and before hurricane season starts.&nbsp; I
      would check the weather, compare prices, research the levels seaweed,
      before booking.</p><p><strong>Packing List for Key West:</strong> Now this
