      <p>Rome, the Eternal City. Full of history, romance, and home to one of
      the Seven Wonders of the World. If you&rsquo;re lucky enough to spend more
      than 3 days in this beautiful city, I recommend taking a day trip! Here
      are 3 day trips from Rome, that I highly recommend!</p><p><em><strong>-
      Tivoli, IT!</strong></em> What a charming city. Home to Hadrian&rsquo;s
      Villa &amp; Villa d&rsquo;Este.&nbsp; Hadrian&rsquo;s Villa is a UNESCO
      World Heritage Site comprising the ruins and archaeological remains built
      c. AD 120 by Roman Emperor Hadrian in Tivoli outside Rome. Villa
      d&rsquo;Este is a symbol of the Italian Renaissance, an Italian State
      Museum, and UNESCO World Heritage Site! Both of these are a site to see.

      took this tour personally</strong></em></a>! Our guide was very
      knowledgable. Tivoli also has a lot of cute shops, trattoria&rsquo;s, and
      kind locals. I highly recommend visiting Tivoli if you have
      time.</p><p><em><strong>- Florence</strong></em> is a great day trip from
      Rome, if you don&rsquo;t have time to spend multiple days there. You will
      easily fall in love with the city, and probably plan a trip back to really
      immerse yourself. It is a quick train ride, and you can easily arrive by 9
      AM and leave by 8PM, meaning you will have a full day to explore! Be sure
      to visit Galleria dell&rsquo;Accademia to see the statue of David. Get
      your tickets in advance!!&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>- Assisi!</em>
      </strong>The city of Assisi makes for a perfect day trip, and it&rsquo;s
      easy to get to! Many buses, trains, and tours connect the two cities.
      Assisi is an Umbrian medieval city. Small enough that you can wander
      around without getting lost, but big enough to spend an entire day. It is
      the birthplace of St. Francis (1181&ndash;1226), one of Italy&rsquo;s
      patron saints.</p><p>Of course there are many different cities to travel
      within Italy, but be sure to give some time to the lesser known cities, as
      well! They are just as beautiful!</p>
