      <p>Our first flight ever as a couple, in fact, Jay's first time on an
      airplane! Now, in my opinion, 3 days is not long enough to really enjoy
      Iceland. However, as we were currently working our traditional 9-5s, this
      is all the time we had, and we wanted to explore, so we didn't let timing
      stop us! Iceland is known as " The Land of Fire and Ice!" and features
      midnight sun in the summer, and the northern lights in the winter. We went
      in July when the weather was surprisingly good, and experienced the
      midnight sun!&nbsp;</p><p>Let's start with flights! We scored great
      flights via the app Hopper! Round trip DFW to KEF for only $400 each on
      United Airlines! We sat in economy, which wasn't bad at all, as we had our
      first layover in Newark airport, then only a 6 hour flight! Food was
      great, I could not sleep because of excitement, but per usual, Jay fell
      asleep, as he can sleep just about anywhere. It was definitely a great
      first flight in his book.&nbsp;</p><p>With 3 days only in Reykjavik, we
      stayed in one place only- &nbsp;the Reykjavik Lights Hotel! A combination
      of northern lights and Icelandic calendar inspired hotel with Laugardalur
      outdoor park located across the road, and in close proximity to the
      Icelandic Phallological Museum, the Sun Voyager, a stainless steel boat
      sculpture, and the mall! The breakfast buffet is complimentary, and the
      hotel also features a bar and bike rentals! There is also a bus stop
      located across the street, which is what we took when going down to the
      city center of reykjavik.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>We arrived early in the morning, so we had a full day ahead! We asked
      the hotel to store our bags until check in, and we were off! We started
      the day by walking to the places in close proximity, mentioned above, and
      spent most of our time at the mall! It was very interesting to see the
      different stores that we do not have in the DFW area. There was even a
      grocery store!! Where we bought a couple of Icelandic snacks and wine.
      From there we walked back to the hotel to drop off everything we bought,
      and set off to the city center!&nbsp;</p><p>Our first matter of business
      was to go to B&aelig;jarins Beztu Pylsur! This "hot dog" stand has been
      around since 1937 and is world renowned! and MAN!!! We still dream of this
      hot dog. An Icelandic hot dog is made from a combination of pork, beef,
      and mostly lamb. Because of the grassfed, roam free Icelandic sheep, you
      can really taste how different and delicious it is compared to the
      american hot dog.&nbsp;</p><p>We continued onto Laugavegur, which is the
      oldest and largest shopping street in Iceland! I do recommend a city tour
      if you are wanting a guide to give you the "lay of the land." I will link
      all tours at the bottom of this post! Be sure not to miss Hallgrimskrkj,
      the iconic church in Reykjavik. There are many parks, buildings, museums,
      bakeries, and shops to stop at. Our favorite place for icelandic ice cream
      was Valdis, and our favorite bakery was BraudCo- they are famous for their
      cinnamon rolls!&nbsp;</p>

      <p>The golden circle! We booked a tour through Viator Travel, and they
      picked us up directly from the hotel! This is one of the most touristic
      things to do in Iceland, but so worth it! You get to see Icelands
      beautiful scenery, and learn about this history along the way! Starting
      off with&nbsp;</p><p>&THORN;ingvellir (Thingvellir) national park! This is
      an UNESCO world heritage site. The park sits within a rift valley, causing
      the separation of two tectonic plates! This is the site of the world's
      oldest existing parliament! You can even scuba dive between the tectonic
      plates in Silfra Fissure to see the crystal clear water. Soon after taking
      in the sights and learning all about the area from our tour guide, we
      headed off to Strokkur Geysir which explodes with water every 5-10
      minutes. As we walked to the site, you can see the steam lifting from the
      ground! Next, our tour included a stop at a local family farm. We were
      welcomed by the free roam sheep and adorable dogs they had on property. We
      went inside where they had a small restaurant, and HOMEMADE ice cream! It
      was absolutely divine. We got to see the cows they had on property, and
      one sweet baby tried to eat my shirt! I was in love! After about 45
      minutes, we headed off to Gullfoss waterfall, one of the largest in
      Iceland. As you walk down you'll feel the mist on your face! Which was
      very refreshing as it was about 70 degrees fahrenheit! Our tour guide said
      we had brought the Texas weather with us. This was a sight to see, and we
      even saw a rainbow right above. It was so beautiful.&nbsp;</p><p>We were
      so tired, in the best way possible, from our day of adventures. We grabbed
      something local to the hotel to eat, and went to bed early to prepare for
      our 3rd and final full day!&nbsp;</p>

      <p>BLUE LAGOON HERE WE COME! The Blue Lagoon is a geothermal spa in
      southwestern Iceland. The spa is located in a lava field near
      Grindav&iacute;k! Our tickets we bought included roundtrip transport from
      our hotel, and entry into the lagoon! It was a bit pricey, but so worth
      it, in our opinion! We took photos all round the property, as the rocky,
      space-like landscape plus the water, was a view to remember. We went in
      and prepped for the lagoon! you must shower before entry, And PLEASE put
      the conditioner in your hair that they provide in the cost of your ticket-
      it's a lifesaver, as the water contains high amounts of silica which is
      where it gets its milky blue shade! We purchased the basic entry fee,
      which included a face mask, and a free drink of choice. I chose a wine,
      and Jay went with a local beer! The Blue Lagoon also features a hotel,
      multiple restaurants, massages, sauna, and more!&nbsp;</p><p>After our
      time at the blue lagoon, we headed back to the hotel! We cleaned up, and
      went back to the city center for our last night. We were sure to eat more
      traditional foods, and snack at all the places we loved so much our first
      day.&nbsp;</p><p>Although we only had 3 full days, I would say we had a
      fantastic time! There is so much to see in Iceland, and we do plan on
      coming back, and spending a lot more time there, hopefully we will travel
      the famous ring road!</p>
