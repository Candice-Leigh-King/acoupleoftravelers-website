      <p>Our first flight ever as a couple, in fact, Jay's first time on an
      airplane! Now, in my opinion, 3 days is not long enough to really enjoy
      Iceland. However, as we were currently working our traditional 9-5s, this
      is all the time we had, and we wanted to explore, so we didn't let timing
      stop us! Iceland is known as " The Land of Fire and Ice!" and features
      midnight sun in the summer, and the northern lights in the winter. We went
      in July when the weather was surprisingly good, and experienced the
      midnight sun!&nbsp;</p><p>Let's start with flights! We scored great
      flights via the app Hopper! Round trip DFW to KEF for only $400 each on
      United Airlines! We sat in economy, which wasn't bad at all, as we had our
      first layover in Newark airport, then only a 6 hour flight! Food was
      great, I could not sleep because of excitement, but per usual, Jay fell
      asleep, as he can sleep just about anywhere. It was definitely a great
      first flight in his book.&nbsp;</p><p>With 3 days only in Reykjavik, we
      stayed in one place only- &nbsp;the Reykjavik Lights Hotel! A combination
      of northern lights and Icelandic calendar inspired hotel with Laugardalur
      outdoor park located across the road, and in close proximity to the
      Icelandic Phallological Museum, the Sun Voyager, a stainless steel boat
      sculpture, and the mall! The breakfast buffet is complimentary, and the
      hotel also features a bar and bike rentals! There is also a bus stop
      located across the street, which is what we took when going down to the
      city center of reykjavik.&nbsp;</p>
