      <p>When people dream of European Travel, a lot think of Italy as their
      first destination, and rightfully so! It is a charming country, full of
      romance and history.</p><p>Italy is one of my favorite places to travel
      too. You can find me sitting on the steps of Ponte Sisto Fountain,
      enjoying live street music in the Trastevere, and eating as much authentic
      Italian food as I can handle.</p><p>When I&rsquo;m in Rome, I love to
      visit Tivoli. It is a small city less than an hour outside of Rome. Many
      tours go here, or you can venture on your own. I recommend a tour with a
      guide for your first time, and you&rsquo;ll definitely want to visit
      again. This is the tour we did:<em><strong> <a target="_blank"

      Tour.</a>&nbsp;</strong></em>Our guide was very knowledgable. Tivoli also
      has a lot of cute shops, trattoria&rsquo;s, and kind locals.</p><p>Tivoli
      is home to Hadrian&rsquo;s Villa &amp; Villa d&rsquo;Este.&nbsp;
      Hadrian&rsquo;s Villa is a UNESCO World Heritage Site comprising the ruins
      and archaeological remains built c. AD 120 by Roman Emperor Hadrian in
      Tivoli outside Rome. Villa d&rsquo;Este is a symbol of the Italian
      Renaissance, an Italian State Museum, and UNESCO World Heritage Site! Both
      of these are a site to see. I highly recommend visiting Tivoli if you have
      time.</p><p>10 Best Things to Do in Tivoli (Italy):</p><ul><li>Villa
