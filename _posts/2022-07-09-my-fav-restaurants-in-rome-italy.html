      <p><strong>My fav restaurants in Rome! </strong>When searching for the
      best food in a new destinations, I do lots of research. Below are my fav
      spots &amp; a little about each:</p><p><strong>Mattarello
      Parioli</strong>: HOMEMADE PASTA. Need I say more? This restaurant is a
      local FAV! It&rsquo;s only about a 5 minute walk from Villa Borghese/
      Zoologica.</p><p><strong>Caffe Hungaria</strong>- A very cute cafe, and an
      instagramable location that is off the beaten path! The pastries are
      DELICIOUS. You have to try as many as you can.</p><p><strong>Taverna
      Rossini-</strong> A classic! The pasta dishes were very good. My favorite
      however, was the ravioli. It was *chefs
      kiss*.</p><p><strong>Trapizzino</strong>- AN ICONIC STOP IN TRASTEVERE!
      These are legendary and eaten by locals daily! We stopped here on our food
      tour, and it was one of our favorite spots.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Osteria
      PePPO</strong>- Located in Trastevere. The chef is so kind! This was one
      of the stops on our food tour- the wine &amp; pasta were sooo good! Highly
      recommend.</p><p><strong>The Gelatist</strong>- man oh man does this place
      have good cannoli. The candid orange really sets it apart from
      others!</p><p><strong>Fonte Della Salute Gelato</strong> - you need to try
      the pistachio and dark chocolate, end of story. My absolute
      favorites!</p><p>All of these are off the beaten path. They are not the
      *most Instagramable locations* but they are GOOD &amp;
      authentic!&nbsp;</p><p>Follow me on Tiktok and IG for videos of all these
      places!&nbsp;</p>
