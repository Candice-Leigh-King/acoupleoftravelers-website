      <h3>Glen Rose, Texas</h3><p>Welcome to The Lone Star State! Home of good
      BBQ, Rodeo's, The Alamo, and SO much more! Today we are going to be
      discussing one of our favorite staycations in North Texas</p><p>Glen Rose-
      The dinosaur capital of Texas!&nbsp; One of our favorite staycation
      cities. With so much to offer, this city is makes for a perfect weekend
      getaway!&nbsp;</p><p>Where to stay: SkyBox Cabins. Featured in Southern
      Living Magazine, Skybox Cabins have a unique twist when it comes to their
      unique cabins/treehouses. We had the opportunity to stay in "The
      Birdhouse'." It was a real treat! We enjoyed coffee at sunrise on our
      balcony that overlooked the treetops! They are big on disconnecting from
      electronics. They want you to enjoy nature with the company you bring. You
      can book on airbnb or book directly from their website here:&nbsp;<a
      target="_blank"
      href="https://www.skyboxcabins.com/cabins">https://www.skyboxcabins.com/cabins</a></p><p>What
      to do: You're in for a treat! There is much to do in Glen Rose. If you're
      staying at Skybox Cabins, you're about 5 minutes from DINOSAUR VALLEY
      STATE PARK! Long ago, dinosaurs roamed the area, and left amazing
      footprints in the river. You can see these impressions, learn about them,
      and can even kayak the river, and go hiking. Check their website for trail
      status and dinosaur track visibility. &nbsp;</p><p>You can also enjoy Big
      Rocks Park! The name comes from the unusually large rocks on the banks of
      the Paluxy River. This is a great spot for picnics, relaxing, and taking
      some pretty fun photos! This park is also in close proximity to beautiful
      Downton Glen Rose! This historic downtown square is perfect for grabbing
      coffee, a bite to eat, and visiting antique stores.</p><p>Where to eat:
      Like we said in the beginning, Texas is known for BBQ! So first on our
      list is Hammond's! A local favorite. They have been serving BBQ in Glen
      Rose since 1996! Our next go-to spot is Riverhouse Grill! A family owned
      restaurant serving up delicious food in a historic house! Sunday brunch is
      highly encouraged!&nbsp;</p><p>Glen Rose is not the most popular
      destination in Texas, but it should definitely be on your list!&nbsp;</p>
