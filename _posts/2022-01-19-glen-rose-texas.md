      <p>Welcome to The Lone Star State! Home of good BBQ, Rodeo's, The Alamo,
      and SO much more! Today we are going to be discussing one of our favorite
      staycations in North Texas.</p><p>Glen Rose- The dinosaur capital of
      Texas!&nbsp; One of our favorite staycation cities. With so much to offer,
      this city is makes for a perfect weekend getaway!&nbsp;</p><p>Where to
      stay: SkyBox Cabins. Featured in Southern Living Magazine, Skybox Cabins
      have a unique twist when it comes to their unique cabins/treehouses. We
      had the opportunity to stay in "The Birdhouse'." It was a real treat! We
      enjoyed coffee at sunrise on our balcony that overlooked the treetops!
      They are big on disconnecting from electronics. They want you to enjoy
      nature with the company you bring. You can book on airbnb or book directly
      from their website here:&nbsp;<a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.skyboxcabins.com/cabins">https://www.skyboxcabins.com/cabins</a></p><p>What
      to do: You're in for a treat! There is much to do in Glen Rose. If you're
      staying at Skybox Cabins, you're about 5 minutes from DINOSAUR VALLEY
      STATE PARK! Long ago, dinosaurs roamed the area, and left amazing
      footprints in the river. You can see these impressions, learn about them,
      and can even kayak the river, and go hiking. Check their website for trail
      status and dinosaur track visibility. &nbsp;</p><p>You can also enjoy Big
      Rocks Park! The name comes from the unusually large rocks on the banks of
      the Paluxy River. This is a great spot for picnics, relaxing, and taking
      some pretty fun photos! This park is also in close proximity to beautiful
      Downton Glen Rose! This historic downtown square is perfect for grabbing
      coffee, a bite to eat, and visiting antique stores.</p><p>Where to eat:
      Like we said in the beginning, Texas is known for BBQ! So first on our
      list is Hammond's! A local favorite. They have been serving BBQ in Glen
      Rose since 1996! Our next go-to spot is Riverhouse Grill! A family owned
      restaurant serving up delicious food in a historic house! Sunday brunch is
      highly encouraged!&nbsp;</p><p>Glen Rose is not the most popular
      destination in Texas, but it should definitely be on your list!</p>
