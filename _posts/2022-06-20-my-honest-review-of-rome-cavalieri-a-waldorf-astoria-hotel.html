      <p>When I tell you this place is my <strong>favorite</strong> hotel
      I&rsquo;ve ever been to,<em> I MEAN IT</em>! Here&rsquo;s
      why-</p><p>Luxurious is an understatement! This hotel is a perfect getaway
      for those that want luxury but don&rsquo;t want to pay thousands of
      dollars. (If you&rsquo;re a Hilton honors member, you can book on points!
      Click <em><a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
      href="http://refer.amex.us/LOGANHYqsr?xl=cp15">here</a> </em>to sign up
      for their credit card &amp; earn points easily. Not financial advice.
      Please talk with a financial advisor.)</p><p>Their breakfast is<em> *chefs
      kiss*</em> and I&rsquo;m addicted to their eggs. I dream of them.
      (Complimentary when staying there too!)</p><p>They have a 3 Michelin Star
      restaurant on site called La Pergola! We haven&rsquo;t had a chance to
      dine here unfortunately, so make sure you get reservations!!! Don&rsquo;t
      be like us and miss out.</p><p>The spa is beautiful with an indoor pool,
      saunas, massages, and more! We loved going in the evening when you can see
      how dark it is outside &amp; the indoor pool is glowing.</p><p>The rooms
      are so unique. They definitely give off the Italian vibe! Check out a
      tour<a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
      href="https://www.tiktok.com/@vibesoflolo/video/7091318840369483054?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7098784057816024622"><em>
      here</em></a>!</p><p>The customer service is impeccable! They really do go
      above and beyond. We have stayed here multiple times, and one time when we
      stayed, they forgot our complimentary water. Later, they surprised us with
      not only a lot more water, but gourmet chocolates! How sweet is
      that!!</p><p>Now, I know what you&rsquo;re thinking. This sounds too good
      to be true. Where is it located? Can I walk everywhere? Well- it is
      outside of the city center, HOWEVER, they have a complimentary shuttle
      that drops you off about a 10 min walk to the Trevi fountain! It picks up
      &amp; drops off in the same spot every day at the same times, and the
      front desk will provide you a guide with a map &amp; times the shuttle is
      going. We found it very efficient &amp; worked perfectly.</p><p>If
      you&rsquo;re looking for a more budget friendly accommodation in Rome (or
      looking for another Hilton that cost less in points) click <a
