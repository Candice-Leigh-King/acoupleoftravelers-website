      <p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a hotel that&rsquo;s somewhere <em>between
      bougie and on a budge</em>t, this one is for you!</p><p>Located a 5 min
      walk away from Villa Borghese is Hilton Garden Inn Rome Claridge! If you
      are a Hilton honors member, use your points! We booked this hotel using
      30,000 points per night! What a steal! (Click this <a target="_blank"

      the Hilton Honors Amex card &amp; earn points on every day spending! *Not
      financial advice. Please do your own research and talk to a financial
      advisor with questions.*)</p><p>The staff is very welcoming, and on our
      second trip to Rome, they set us up with a private shuttle to pick us up
      from the airport! They made it very stress free, especially arriving after
      a red eye flight!</p><p>We have stayed here twice &amp; had a fabulous
      stay each time! (Click<a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
      href="https://www.tiktok.com/@vibesoflolo/video/7098717695553654062?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7098784057816024622">
      <em>here</em></a><em> </em>for our room/hotel tour) we stayed in this room
      the first time we visited, and stayed in a smaller room the second time!
      ** TIP if you come during off season be sure to ask up front if the air
      conditioning is running.**</p><p>Complimentary breakfast is self serve
      buffet style. They had typical Italian staples like cappuccinos and
      pastries, and typical American staples like eggs, waffles, and bacon. They
      have other options, as well! It&rsquo;s a great way to start the day, so
      you can fuel yourself for your day of adventures!</p><p>There is an
      on-site bar that serves aperitivo, which is a must in Italy. They offer
      room service if you&rsquo;re too tired from walking all day! However, the
      location is right next to 3 of my favorite restaurants in Rome, so I would
      definitely walk l Caffe Hungaria, Mattarello Pariloi, or Taverna Rossini.

      about this hotel is it&rsquo;s not all tourist. There were other locals
      having breakfast there, having meetings, and the restaurants nearby had
      locals, and not every one working spoke English. That&rsquo;s how you know
      the food is going to be fabulous!</p><p>They do have a gym on site if
      that&rsquo;s important to you! When in Rome you&rsquo;ll do a lot of
      walking, but if you need some weight lifting in your life, they got you
      covered!</p><p>There are many options&nbsp; for hotels throughout Rome,
      but this one is definitely worth checking out!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>**This
