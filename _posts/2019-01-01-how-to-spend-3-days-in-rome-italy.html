      <p><strong>The PERFECT 3-day Rome, Italy itinerary</strong></p><p>&nbsp;
      Rome, Italy is A DREAM vacation! It is best known for the ancient Roman
      Colosseum- one of the seven wonders of the world, and for good reason!
      When you are in its&rsquo; presence, an overwhelming feeling of beauty,
      wonder, and adventure washes over you. This is the sight of so much
      history. Rome as a whole is filled with history, and can be overwhelming
      when trying to plan. That&rsquo;s what I am here for! I&rsquo;m going to
      give you the travel guide to Rome that you have been searching
      for.</p><p>&nbsp; Imagine eating gelato at the Trevi Fountain or eating
      pizza with The Colosseum behind you. Not only are these instagrammable
      photo opportunities; they are memories you will never forget! Rome can be
      overwhelming.. there is just so much to see and do, but I&rsquo;m here to
      help! Here is your 3-day Rome, Italy Travel Guide:</p><p><strong>QUICK
      TIPS:</strong></p><ul><li>Go during off season! I love the fall (October).
      The weather is nice, and it is not so crowded!</li><li>Learn a few Italian
      phrases! Most will speak English, so don&rsquo;t let this deter you. It is
      just always kind to learn a bit of the language of the country you are
      traveling to!</li><li>Make sure you have a travel credit card that does
      not charge international fees and have some euros on hand just
      incase!</li><li>WALK! This city is extremely walkable. It&rsquo;s
      beautiful to stroll the streets and take-in the beauty.</li><li>Wear
      comfortable shoes! <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
      href="https://amzn.to/3AyqxM2">These sandals were perfect for all of the
      miles I walked!&nbsp;</a></li><li>Book tickets to attractions in
      advance!</li><li>Never order a cappuccino after 11
      AM!</li></ul><p><strong>WHERE TO STAY:</strong></p><p>We travel using
      points to book hotels. We stayed at:</p><ul><li>The Rome Cavalieri (click

      for my honest review)</li></ul><p><strong>WHAT TO DO:</strong></p><p>Day
      1: Wake up early! Don&rsquo;t let your day go to waste. If you&rsquo;re
      staying at either of the Hiltons I mentioned above, breakfast *should* be
      apart of your stay. Fuel up early for your long, but wonderful, day ahead!
      Start at Piazza Navona. I loved seeing it practically empty when starting
      here. If you happened to miss breakfast, have a typical Italian breakfast
      (cappuccino &amp; pastry) nearby.</p><p>From here, walk to The Pantheon!
      Entrance is free, but lines start early. You can also book a guided tour
      and skip the line. I recommend this one! After this, go have an aperol
      spritz and some lunch!</p><p>After lunch, head to the colosseum! Book an
      afternoon guided tour of the colosseum, roman forum, and palatine hill! <a
      target="_blank" rel="noopener"
      href="https://www.viator.com/tours/Rome/Skip-the-line-Colosseum-and-Ancient-Rome/d511-134303P1?pid=P00054407&amp;mcid=42383&amp;medium=link&amp;campaign=rome-itin">I
      recommend this one!&nbsp;</a></p><p>This will take most of the afternoon.
      Savor every moment of seeing this history. You will learn all about the
      gladiators, which was quite fascinating. It is a lot of walking and
      standing, so be sure to wear comfortable shoes! I recommend
      these!</p><p>By now it will be late afternoon/early evening, so go grab
      some gelato! Tip: Avoid mountains of bright colors! These are not
      authentic and tend to have preservatives &amp; coloring. Your best bet is
      choosing gelato that is inside stainless steel tubs! Don&rsquo;t worry
      about having dessert before dinner. You&rsquo;re on vacation, remember?
      Stroll the cobblestone streets as you enjoy your creamy gelato. Take in
      all of the sights.</p><p>Now, head to dinner! Be sure to do extensive
      research, and don&rsquo;t dine at a tourist trap!</p><p>Day 2: Just like
      yesterday, start your day early! Fuel up, and get the day started! Head
      over to Vatican City! Visit the Sistine Chapel, St Peter&rsquo;s Basilica,
      and The Vatican Museums! Some prefer a guided tour in order to skip the
      lines, and others prefer to do it all on their own. Either way, you need
      to get your tickets early! Be sure to climb to the very top of the dome,
      this is a work out, but it is so worth it. The views of Rome are
      breathtaking. We spent so much time taking it all in! If you explore
      Vatican City will take up most of your day, so once finished head over to
      the Trastevere neighborhood! It is a gem! If you choose to walk, you see
      so many beautiful sights.<a target="_blank" rel="noopener"

      I recommend an evening food tour in the Trastevere!&nbsp;</a></p><p>The
      area is lively, we experienced lovely live music in front of Fontana del
      Ponte Sisto! Everyone was dancing, smiling, clapping&hellip; I felt as if
      I was in a movie! <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
      href="https://www.viator.com/tours/Rome/The-Roman-Food-tour-in-Trastevere/d511-12438P4?pid=P00054407&amp;mcid=42383&amp;medium=link&amp;campaign=rome-itin">For
      the food tour, we did this one! &nbsp;LOVED IT! </a>Every food item we had
      was delicious &amp; the wine was too! It was a fabulous way to end our
      day.</p><p>Day 3: Your final day in Rome! Let&rsquo;s head straight to the
      Trevi Fountain. Get there early or you will be in a crowd of people! Make
      a wish, throw your coin in, and live out your Lizzie McGuire dreams! From
      there, go to the secret archaeological site under the Trevi Fountain!
      It&rsquo;s a HIDDEN GEM! The Vicus Caprarius is known as The City of Water
      and the entrance is right around the corner from the Trevi Fountain. Not
      only will you see the ancient aqueducts, but hundreds of artifacts from
      excavation! It cost about 4 Euro, so this makes it a very cheap thing to
      do in Rome!</p><p>After all of this exploring in the early morning, go
      grab a cappuccino &amp; pastry! Then, walk to the Spanish steps! Wonder
      around the cobblestone streets and take your time!</p><p>After the Spanish
      Steps, go find somewhere for lunch! Remember, don&rsquo;t fall for tourist
      spots! I recommend walking a bit away from any tourist hotspots to find
      the best option.</p><p>After lunch, walk to Villa Borghese. This is one of
      my favorite places in all of Rome! Gardens, museums, a dog park towards
      the back, even the zoo is connected! My most favorite moment when visiting
      Rome is watching all of the locals lay in fields of grass with the sun
      shining on their faces, books in hand, picnics everywhere. It was picture
      perfect. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"

      guided tour is a must if you want to really understand all of the artwork
      in the Borghese Gallery.&nbsp;</a></p><p>Also, do the boat ride at
      Giardino del Lago! You have to! It is so beautiful, romantic, and once you
      see it in person, you will feel the same way.</p><p>By now, it will be
      evening. Choose a cooking class &amp; learn how to make authentic Italian
      pasta, pizza, or tiramisu! It&rsquo;s a fun activity, you will learn a
      lot, and connect with locals. Plus, you&rsquo;ll get a very yummy meal out
      of it.&nbsp;<a

      hope this itinerary helps you have an amazing time in Rome! I didn&rsquo;t
      fill it with too much, because you want time to savor the eternal city.
